# SMX API POC

This is just a crude proof of concept to be used as a building block for interfacing with the SMX Northbound Interface API.
Environment varialbes should be set in `.env` file prior to running.

```.env
SMX_API_URL=https://{SMX_IP}:{API_PORT}/rest/v1/
SMX_USERNAME={username}
SMX_PASSWORD={password}
```
